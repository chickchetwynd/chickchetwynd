### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Chick Chetwynd

I'm a Data Analyst living in San Francisco :man_cartwheeling: :partying_face: :confetti_ball: :balloon:

I am a career changer and currently looking for my first role in Data Analytics! Take a look at my [portfolio](https://github.com/chickchetwynd/portfolio) to see projects that I've worked on.


#### What I'm currently focusing on :thinking::

<br />

:white_check_mark: My main strengths are in SQL where I am familiar with Standard SQL, PostgresQL, and Google Standard SQL.
<br />
:white_check_mark: I have completed Google's [Data Analytics Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none) as well as content from [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn) and [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/learning-path).
<br />
:white_check_mark: Creating powerful vizualizations with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chick.chetwynd) to highlight data insites.
<br />
:white_check_mark: I am currently learning Python with the goal of creating Jupyter notebooks where coding, analysis, and data vizualisation can all happen in the same place!
